### Bias towards action

(Taken from [Astral's values](https://astral-sh.notion.site/Astral-s-Values-0ed6a642bcc84e91af6836b2373572f5):)

We bias towards action, even in the face of uncertainty. We favor **pragmatic doing** over **prolonged debating**; we favor asking for **forgiveness** over **permission**. We value **decisiveness** — especially when a decision isn’t clear cut, and **especially** when a decision is reversible.

A bias towards action is **not** the same as recklessness. Rather, it’s a bias towards making **responsible** decisions and acting on them with _urgency_, even if we’re left with lingering ambiguity or known unknowns.
