# Getting Started

## Overview

The JavaScript Oxidation Compiler (Oxc) is a collection of high-performance tools for the JavaScript language written in Rust.

Our focus lies in constructing essential compiler tools for JavaScript: parser, linter, formatter, transpiler, minifier and resolver.

Additionally, we provide support for emerging JavaScript tools like Rspack, Rolldown, and Ezno.

Our goal is to create and empower tooling for [The Third Age of JavaScript](https://www.swyx.io/js-third-age).

## Philosophy

This project shares the same philosophies as [Biome][biome] and [Ruff][ruff].

1. JavaScript tooling could be rewritten in a more performant language.
2. An integrated toolchain can tap into efficiencies that are not available to a disparate set of tools.

## Adoptions

- A 5M LOC TypeScript codebase previously running ESLint parallelized across 48 workers in CI taking 75 mins (12m wall time), it is now 8 seconds on a single worker. ([Source](https://twitter.com/boshen_c/status/1714827365136929029))

> Forâ€¦reasons I am experimenting w various Rust-based JS compilers. I donâ€™t agree w every design decision but overall oxc is really well done.
