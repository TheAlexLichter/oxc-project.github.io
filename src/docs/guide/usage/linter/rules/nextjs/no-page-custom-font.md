# nextjs/no-page-custom-font <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Prevent page-only custom fonts.

### Why is this bad?

- The custom font you're adding was added to a page - this only adds the font to the specific page and not the entire application.
- The custom font you're adding was added to a separate component within pages/\_document.js - this disables automatic font optimization.

### Example

```javascript

```
