# jsx_a11y/role-has-required-aria-props <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">âœ…</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Enforces that elements with ARIA roles must have all required attributes
for that role.

### Why is this bad?

Certain ARIA roles require specific attributes to express necessary
semantics for assistive technology.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
<div role="checkbox" />
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
<div role="checkbox" aria-checked="false" />
```
