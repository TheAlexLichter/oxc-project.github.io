# jsx_a11y/no-distracting-elements <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">âœ…</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Enforces that no distracting elements are used.

### Why is this necessary?

Elements that can be visually distracting can cause accessibility issues
with visually impaired users. Such elements are most likely deprecated,
and should be avoided. By default, `<marquee>` and `<blink>` elements
are visually distracting.

### What it checks

This rule checks for marquee and blink element.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
<marquee />
<marquee {...props} />
<marquee lang={undefined} />
<blink />
<blink {...props} />
<blink foo={undefined} />
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
<div />
<Marquee />
<Blink />
```
