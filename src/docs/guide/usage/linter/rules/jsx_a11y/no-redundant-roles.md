### What it does

Enforces that the explicit `role` property is not the same as
implicit/default role property on element.

### Why is this bad?

Redundant roles can lead to confusion and verbosity in the codebase.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
<nav role="navigation" />
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
<nav />
```
