# jsx_a11y/heading-has-content <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Enforce that heading elements (h1, h2, etc.) have content and
that the content is accessible to screen readers.
Accessible means that it is not hidden using the aria-hidden prop.

### Why is this bad?

Screen readers alert users to the presence of a heading tag.
If the heading is empty or the text cannot be accessed,
this could either confuse users or even prevent them
from accessing information on the page's structure.

### Example

```jsx
// Bad
<h1 />

// Good
<h1>Foo</h1>
```
