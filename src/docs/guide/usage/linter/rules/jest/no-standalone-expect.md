# jest/no-standalone-expect <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">âœ…</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Prevents `expect` statements outside of a `test` or `it` block. An `expect`
within a helper function (but outside of a `test` or `it` block) will not
trigger this rule.

Statements like `expect.hasAssertions()` will NOT trigger this rule since these
calls will execute if they are not in a test block.

### Example

```javascript
describe("a test", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```
