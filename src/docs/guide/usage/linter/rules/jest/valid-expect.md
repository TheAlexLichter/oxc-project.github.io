# jest/valid-expect <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

This rule triggers a warning if `expect()` is called with more than one argument
or without arguments. It would also issue a warning if there is nothing called
on `expect()`, e.g.:

### Example

```javascript
expect();
expect("something");
expect(true).toBeDefined;
expect(Promise.resolve("Hi!")).resolves.toBe("Hi!");
```

This rule is compatible with [eslint-plugin-vitest](https://github.com/veritem/eslint-plugin-vitest/blob/v1.1.9/docs/rules/valid-expect.md),
to use it, add the following configuration to your `.eslintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "vitest/valid-expect": "error"
  }
}
```
