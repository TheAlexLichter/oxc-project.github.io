### What it does

Checks that `expect()` is called correctly.

Why is this bad?

`expect()` is a function that is used to assert values in tests. It should be called with a single argument, which is the value to be tested. If you call `expect()` with no arguments, or with more than one argument, it will not work as expected.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
expect();
expect("something");
expect(true).toBeDefined;
expect(Promise.resolve("Hi!")).resolves.toBe("Hi!");
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
expect("something").toEqual("something");
expect(true).toBeDefined();
expect(Promise.resolve("Hi!")).resolves.toBe("Hi!");
```

This rule is compatible with [eslint-plugin-vitest](https://github.com/veritem/eslint-plugin-vitest/blob/v1.1.9/docs/rules/valid-expect.md),
to use it, add the following configuration to your `.eslintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "vitest/valid-expect": "error"
  }
}
```
