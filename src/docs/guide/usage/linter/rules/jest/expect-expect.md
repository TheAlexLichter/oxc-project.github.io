### What it does

This rule triggers when there is no call made to `expect` in a test, ensure that there is at least one `expect` call made in a test.

### Why is this bad?

People may forget to add assertions.

### Example

```javascript
it("should be a test", () => {
  console.log("no assertion");
});
test("should assert something", () => {});
```

This rule is compatible with [eslint-plugin-vitest](https://github.com/veritem/eslint-plugin-vitest/blob/v1.1.9/docs/rules/expect-expect.md),
to use it, add the following configuration to your `.eslintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "vitest/expect-expect": "error"
  }
}
```
