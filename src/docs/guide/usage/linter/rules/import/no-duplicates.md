### What it does

Reports if a resolved path is imported more than once in the same module.
This helps avoid unnecessary duplicate imports and keeps the code clean.

### Why is this bad?

Importing the same module multiple times can lead to redundancy and
unnecessary complexity. It also affects maintainability, as it might
confuse developers and result in inconsistent usage of imports across the code.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
import { foo } from "./module";
import { bar } from "./module";
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
import { foo, bar } from "./module";
```
