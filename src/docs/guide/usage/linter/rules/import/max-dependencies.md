### What it does

Forbid modules to have too many dependencies (import or require statements).

### Why is this bad?

This is a useful rule because a module with too many dependencies is a code smell, and
usually indicates the module is doing too much and/or should be broken up into smaller
modules.

### Example

Given `{"max": 2}`

```javascript
import a from "./a";
import b from "./b";
import c from "./c";
```
