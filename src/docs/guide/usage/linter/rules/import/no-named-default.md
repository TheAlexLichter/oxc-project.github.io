<div class="rule-meta">

### What it does

Reports use of a default export as a locally named import.

### Why is this bad?

Rationale: the syntax exists to import default exports expressively, let's use it.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
// message: Using exported name 'bar' as identifier for default export.
import { default as foo } from "./foo.js";
import { default as foo, bar } from "./foo.js";
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
import foo from "./foo.js";
import foo, { bar } from "./foo.js";
```
