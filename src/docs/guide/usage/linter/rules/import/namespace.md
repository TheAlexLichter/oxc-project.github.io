### What it does

Enforces names exist at the time they are dereferenced, when imported as
a full namespace (i.e. `import * as foo from './foo'; foo.bar();` will
report if bar is not exported by `./foo.`). Will report at the import
declaration if there are no exported names found. Also, will report for
computed references (i.e. `foo["bar"]()`). Reports on assignment to a
member of an imported namespace.
