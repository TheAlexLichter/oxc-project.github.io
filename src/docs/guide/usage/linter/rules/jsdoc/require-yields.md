### What it does

Requires that yields are documented.
Will also report if multiple `@yields` tags are present.

### Why is this bad?

The rule is intended to prevent the omission of `@yields` tags when they are necessary.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
function* quux(foo) {
  yield foo;
}

/**
 * @yields {undefined}
 * @yields {void}
 */
function* quux(foo) {}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
/** * @yields Foo */
function* quux(foo) {
  yield foo;
}
```
