### What it does

Require each enum member value to be explicitly initialized.

### Why is this bad?

In projects where the value of `enum` members are important, allowing implicit values for enums can cause bugs if enums are modified over time.

### Example

```typescript
// wrong, the value of `Close` is not constant
enum Status {
  Open = 1,
  Close,
}
```
