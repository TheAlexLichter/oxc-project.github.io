<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow the declaration of empty interfaces.

### Why is this bad?

An empty interface in TypeScript does very little: any non-nullable value is assignable to {}.
Using an empty interface is often a sign of programmer error, such as misunderstanding the concept of {} or forgetting to fill in fields.
This rule aims to ensure that only meaningful interfaces are declared in the code.

### Example

```ts
interface Foo {}
interface Bar extends Foo {}
```
