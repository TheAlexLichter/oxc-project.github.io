### What it does

Disallow `require` statements except in import statements

### Why is this bad?

In other words, the use of forms such as var foo = require("foo") are banned. Instead use ES6 style imports or import foo = require("foo") imports.

```typescript
var foo = require("foo");
const foo = require("foo");
let foo = require("foo");
```
