### What it does

Disallow non-null assertions using the ! postfix operator.

### Why is this bad?

TypeScript's ! non-null assertion operator asserts to the type system that an expression is non-nullable, as in not null or undefined. Using assertions to tell the type system new information is often a sign that code is not fully type-safe. It's generally better to structure program logic so that TypeScript understands when values may be nullable.

### Example

```ts
x!;
x!.y;
x.y!;
```
