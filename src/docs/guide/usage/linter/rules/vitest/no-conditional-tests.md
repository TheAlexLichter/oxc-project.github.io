<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

The rule disallows the use of conditional statements within test cases to
ensure that tests are deterministic and clearly readable.

### Why is this bad?

Conditional statements in test cases can make tests unpredictable and
harder to understand. Tests should be consistent and straightforward to
ensure reliable results and maintainability.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
describe("my tests", () => {
  if (true) {
    it("is awesome", () => {
      doTheThing();
    });
  }
});
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
describe("my tests", () => {
  it("is awesome", () => {
    doTheThing();
  });
});
```
