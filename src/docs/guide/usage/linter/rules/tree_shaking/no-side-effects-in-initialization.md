### What it does

Marks all side-effects in module initialization that will interfere with tree-shaking.

This plugin is intended as a means for library developers to identify patterns that will
interfere with the tree-shaking algorithm of their module bundler (i.e. rollup or webpack).

### Why is this bad?

### Example

```javascript
myGlobal = 17; // Cannot determine side-effects of assignment to global variable
const x = { [globalFunction()]: "myString" }; // Cannot determine side-effects of calling global function
export default 42;
```

### Options

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "tree-shaking/no-side-effects-in-initialization": [
      2,
      {
        "noSideEffectsWhenCalled": [
          // If you want to mark a function call as side-effect free
          { "function": "Object.freeze" },
          {
            "module": "react",
            "functions": ["createContext", "createRef"]
          },
          {
            "module": "zod",
            "functions": ["array", "string", "nativeEnum", "number", "object", "optional"]
          },
          {
            "module": "my/local/module",
            "functions": ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
          },
          // If you want to whitelist all functions of a module
          {
            "module": "lodash",
            "functions": "*"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Magic Comments

Besides the configuration, you can also use magic comments to mark a function call as side effect free.

By default, imported functions are assumed to have side-effects, unless they are marked with a magic comment:

```js
import { /* tree-shaking no-side-effects-when-called */ x } from "./some-file";
x();
```

`@__PURE__` is also supported:

```js
import { x } from "./some-file";
/*@__PURE__*/ x();
```
