### What it does

This rule warns when the `replaceAll` method is called with a regular expression that does not have the global flag (g).

### Why is this bad?

The `replaceAll` method replaces all occurrences of a string with another string. If the global flag (g) is not used in the regular expression, only the first occurrence of the string will be replaced.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
withSpaces.replaceAll(/\s+/, ",");
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
withSpaces.replaceAll(/\s+/g, ",");
```
