### What it does

This rule warns when the `replaceAll` method is called with a regular expression that does not have the global flag (g).

### Why is this bad?

The `replaceAll` method replaces all occurrences of a string with another string. If the global flag (g) is not used in the regular expression, only the first occurrence of the string will be replaced.

### Example

```javascript
// Bad: The global flag (g) is missing in the regular expression.
withSpaces.replaceAll(/\s+/, ",");

// Good: The global flag (g) is used in the regular expression.
withSpaces.replaceAll(/\s+/g, ",");
```
