### What it does

Disallows the use of approximate constants, instead preferring the use
of the constants in the `Math` object.

### Why is this bad?

Approximate constants are not as accurate as the constants in the `Math` object.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
let log10e = 0.434294;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
let log10e = Math.LOG10E;
```
