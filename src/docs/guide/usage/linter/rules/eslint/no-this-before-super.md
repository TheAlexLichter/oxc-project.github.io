### What it does

Requires calling `super()` before using `this` or `super`.

### Why is this bad?

Getters should always return a value.
If they don't, it's probably a mistake.

### Example

```javascript
class A1 extends B {
  constructor() {
    // super() needs to be called first
    this.a = 0;
    super();
  }
}
```
