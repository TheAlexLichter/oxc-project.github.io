### What it does

Disallow the use of the **iterator** property

### Why is this bad?

The **iterator** property was a SpiderMonkey extension to JavaScript
that could be used to create custom iterators that are compatible with
JavaScript’s for in and for each constructs. However, this property is
now obsolete, so it should not be used. Here’s an example of how this
used to work:

### Example

```javascript
Foo.prototype.__iterator__ = function () {
  return new FooIterator(this);
};
```
