### What it does

Disallow assigning to imported bindings

### Why is this bad?

The updates of imported bindings by ES Modules cause runtime errors.

### Example

```javascript
import mod, { named } from "./mod.mjs";
import * as mod_ns from "./mod.mjs";

mod = 1; // ERROR: 'mod' is readonly.
named = 2; // ERROR: 'named' is readonly.
mod_ns.named = 3; // ERROR: The members of 'mod_ns' are readonly.
mod_ns = {}; // ERROR: 'mod_ns' is readonly.
// Can't extend 'mod_ns'
Object.assign(mod_ns, { foo: "foo" }); // ERROR: The members of 'mod_ns' are readonly.
```
