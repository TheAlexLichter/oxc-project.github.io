### What it does

Disallows using the global console object.

### Why is this bad?

In JavaScript that is designed to be executed in the browser,
itâ€™s considered a best practice to avoid using methods on console.
Such messages are considered to be for debugging purposes and therefore
not suitable to ship to the client.

### Example

```javascript
console.log("here");
```
