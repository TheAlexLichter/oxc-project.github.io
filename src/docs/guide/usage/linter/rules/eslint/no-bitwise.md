# eslint/no-bitwise <Badge type="info" text="Restriction" />

<div class="rule-meta">

### What it does

Disallow bitwise operators

### Why is this bad?

The use of bitwise operators in JavaScript is very rare and often `&` or `|` is simply a mistyped `&&` or `||`,
which will lead to unexpected behavior.

### Example

```javascript
var x = y | z;
```
