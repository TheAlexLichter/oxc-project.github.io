# eslint/no-multi-str <Badge type="info" text="Style" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow multiline strings.

### Why is this bad?

Some consider this to be a bad practice as it was an undocumented feature of JavaScript
that was only formalized later.

### Example

```javascript
var x =
  "Line 1 \
 Line 2";
```
