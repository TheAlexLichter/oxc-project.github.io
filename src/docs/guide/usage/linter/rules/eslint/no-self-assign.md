### What it does

Disallow assignments where both sides are exactly the same

### Why is this bad?

Self assignments have no effect, so probably those are an error due to incomplete refactoring. Those indicate that what you should do is still remaining.

### Example

```javascript
foo = foo;
[bar, baz] = [bar, qiz];
```
