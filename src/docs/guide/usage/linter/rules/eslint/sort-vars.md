### What it does

When declaring multiple variables within the same block, sorting variable names make it
easier to find necessary variable easier at a later time.

### Why is this bad?

Unsorted variable declarations can make the code harder to read and maintain.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
var b, a;
var a, B, c;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
var a, b, c, d;
var B, a, c;
```
