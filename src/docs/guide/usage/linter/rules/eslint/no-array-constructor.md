### What it does

Disallow array constructor

### Why is this bad?

Use of the Array constructor to construct a new array is generally discouraged in favor of array literal notation because of the single-argument pitfall and because the Array global may be redefined.
The exception is when the Array constructor is used to intentionally create sparse arrays of a specified size by giving the constructor a single numeric argument.

### Example

```javascript
let arr = new Array();
```
