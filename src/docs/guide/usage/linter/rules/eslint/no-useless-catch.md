### What it does

Disallow unnecessary catch clauses

### Why is this bad?

A catch clause that only rethrows the original error is redundant,
and has no effect on the runtime behavior of the program.
These redundant clauses can be a source of confusion and code bloat,
so it’s better to disallow these unnecessary catch clauses.

### Example

```javascript
try {
  doSomethingThatMightThrow();
} catch (e) {
  throw e;
}
```
