### What it does

Disallow new operators with the String, Number, and Boolean objects

### Why is this bad?

The first problem is that primitive wrapper objects are, in fact, objects. That means typeof will return "object" instead of "string", "number", or "boolean".
The second problem comes with boolean objects. Every object is truthy, that means an instance of Boolean always resolves to true even when its actual value is false.

### Example

```javascript
var stringObject = new String("Hello world");
```
