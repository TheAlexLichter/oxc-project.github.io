# eslint/require-yield <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">âœ…</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

This rule generates warnings for generator functions that do not have the yield keyword.

### Why is this bad?

Probably a mistake.

### Example

```javascript
function* foo() {
  return 10;
}
```
