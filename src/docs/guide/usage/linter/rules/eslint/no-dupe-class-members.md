### What it does

Disallow duplicate class members

### Why is this bad?

If there are declarations of the same name in class members,
the last declaration overwrites other declarations silently. It can cause unexpected behaviors.

### Example

```javascript
class A {
  foo() {
    console.log("foo");
  }
  foo = 123;
}
let a = new A();
a.foo(); // Uncaught TypeError: a.foo is not a function
```
