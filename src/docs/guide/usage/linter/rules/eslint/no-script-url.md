# eslint/no-script-url <Badge type="info" text="Style" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow javascript: urls

### Why is this bad?

Using `javascript:` URLs is considered by some as a form of `eval`. Code
passed in `javascript:` URLs must be parsed and evaluated by the browser
in the same way that `eval` is processed. This can lead to security and
performance issues.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule

```javascript
/*eslint no-script-url: "error"*/

location.href = "javascript:void(0)";

location.href = `javascript:void(0)`;
```
