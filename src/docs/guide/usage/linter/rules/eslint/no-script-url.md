# eslint/no-script-url <Badge type="info" text="Style" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow javascript: urls

### Why is this bad?

Using javascript: URLs is considered by some as a form of eval. Code passed in javascript: URLs has to be parsed and evaluated by the browser in the same way that eval is processed.

### Example

```javascript
/*eslint no-script-url: "error"*/

location.href = "javascript:void(0)";

location.href = `javascript:void(0)`;
```
