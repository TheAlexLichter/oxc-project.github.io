# eslint/no-restricted-imports <Badge type="info" text="Style" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

This rule allows you to specify imports that you don’t want to use in your application.
It applies to static imports only, not dynamic ones.

### Why is this bad?

Some imports might not make sense in a particular environment. For example, Node.js’ fs module would not make sense in an environment that didn’t have a file system.

Some modules provide similar or identical functionality, think lodash and underscore. Your project may have standardized on a module. You want to make sure that the other alternatives are not being used as this would unnecessarily bloat the project and provide a higher maintenance cost of two dependencies when one would suffice.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
/*eslint no-restricted-imports: ["error", {
    "name": "disallowed-import",
    "message": "Please use 'allowed-import' instead"
}]*/

import foo from "disallowed-import";
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
/*eslint no-restricted-imports: ["error", {"name": "fs"}]*/

import crypto from "crypto";
export { foo } from "bar";
```
