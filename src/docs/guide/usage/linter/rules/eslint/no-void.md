### What it does

Disallow `void` operators.

Why is this bad

The `void` operator is often used to obtain the `undefined` primitive value, but it is unnecessary. You can use `undefined` directly instead.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```ts
void 0;
var foo = void 0;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```ts
"var foo = bar()";
"foo.void()";
"foo.void = bar";
```
