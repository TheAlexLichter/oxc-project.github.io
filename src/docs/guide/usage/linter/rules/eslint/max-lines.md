### What it does

Enforce a maximum number of lines per file.

### Why is this bad?

Some people consider large files a code smell. Large files tend to do a
lot of things and can make it hard following whatâ€™s going. While there
is not an objective maximum number of lines considered acceptable in a
file, most people would agree it should not be in the thousands.
Recommendations usually range from 100 to 500 lines.
