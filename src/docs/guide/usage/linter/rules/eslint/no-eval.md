# eslint/no-eval <Badge type="info" text="Restriction" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallows referencing the 'eval' function.

### Why is this bad?

Calling 'eval' is not supported in some secure contexts and can lead to
vulnerabilities.

### Example

```javascript
const someString = "console.log('pwned')";
eval(someString);
```
