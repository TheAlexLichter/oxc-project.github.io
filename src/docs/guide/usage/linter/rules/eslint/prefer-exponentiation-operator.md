### What it does

Disallow the use of Math.pow in favor of the \*\* operator

### Why is this bad?

Introduced in ES2016, the infix exponentiation operator \*\* is an alternative for the
standard Math.pow function. Infix notation is considered to be more readable and thus more
preferable than the function notation.

### Example

```javascript
Math.pow(a, b);
```
