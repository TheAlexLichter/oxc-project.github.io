# eslint/no-new <Badge type="info" text="Suspicious" />

### What it does

Disallow new operators outside of assignments or comparisons.

### Why is this bad?

Calling new without assigning or comparing it the reference is thrown away and in many
cases the constructor can be replaced with a function.

### Example

```javascript
new Person();
```
