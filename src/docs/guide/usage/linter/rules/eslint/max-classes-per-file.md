# eslint/max-classes-per-file <Badge type="info" text="Pedantic" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Enforce a maximum number of classes per file

### Why is this bad?

Files containing multiple classes can often result in a less navigable and poorly
structured codebase. Best practice is to keep each file limited to a single responsibility.

### Example

```javascript
class Foo {}
class Bar {}
```
