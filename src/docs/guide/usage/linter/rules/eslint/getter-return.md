# eslint/getter-return <Badge type="info" text="Nursery" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Requires all getters to have a return statement

### Why is this bad?

Getters should always return a value. If they don't, it's probably a mistake.

### Example

```javascript
class Person {
  get name() {
    // no return
  }
}
```
