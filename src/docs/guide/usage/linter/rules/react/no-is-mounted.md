# react/no-is-mounted <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">âœ…</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

This rule prevents using isMounted in ES6 classes

### Why is this bad?

isMounted is an antipattern, is not available when using ES6 classes,
and it is on its way to being officially deprecated.///

### Example

```jsx
class Hello extends React.Component {
  someMethod() {
    if (!this.isMounted()) {
      return;
    }
  }
  render() {
    return <div onClick={this.someMethod.bind(this)}>Hello</div>;
  }
}
```
