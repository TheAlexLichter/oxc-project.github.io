### What it does

Disallow missing React when using JSX

### Why is this bad?

When using JSX, `<a />` expands to `React.createElement("a")`. Therefore
the `React` variable must be in scope.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
var a = <a />;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
import React from "react";
var a = <a />;
```
