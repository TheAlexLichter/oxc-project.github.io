# react/button-has-type <Badge type="info" text="Restriction" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Enforces explicit `type` attribute for all the `button` HTML elements.

### Why is this bad?

The default value of `type` attribute for `button` HTML element is
`"submit"` which is often not the desired behavior and may lead to
unexpected page reloads.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
<button />
<button type="foo" />
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
<button type="button" />
<button type="submit" />
```
