### What it does

Disallow return statements in a finally() callback of a promise.

### Why is this bad?

Disallow return statements inside a callback passed to finally(), since nothing would
consume what's returned.

### Example

```javascript
myPromise.finally(function (val) {
  return val;
});
```
