# promise/no-return-in-finally <Badge type="info" text="Nursery" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow return statements in a finally() callback of a promise.

### Why is this bad?

Disallow return statements inside a callback passed to finally(), since nothing would
consume what's returned.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
myPromise.finally(function (val) {
  return val;
});
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
Promise.resolve(1).finally(() => {
  console.log(2);
});
```
