<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Prefer `await` to `then()`/`catch()`/`finally()` for reading Promise values

### Why is this bad?

Async/await syntax can be seen as more readable.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
function foo() {
  hey.then((x) => {});
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
async function hi() {
  await thing();
}
```
