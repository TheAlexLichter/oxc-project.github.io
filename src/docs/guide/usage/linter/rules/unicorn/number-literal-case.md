### What it does

This rule enforces proper case for numeric literals.

### Why is this bad?

When both an identifier and a number literal are in lower case, it can be hard to differentiate between them.

### Example

```javascript
// Fail
const foo = 0xff;
const foo = 0xff;
const foo = 0xff;
const foo = 0xffn;

const foo = 0b10;
const foo = 0b10n;

const foo = 0o76;
const foo = 0o76n;

const foo = 2e-5;

// Pass
const foo = 0xff;
const foo = 0b10;
const foo = 0o76;
const foo = 0xffn;
const foo = 2e5;
```
