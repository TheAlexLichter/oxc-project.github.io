### What it does

Disallow classes that only have static members.

### Why is this bad?

A class with only static members could just be an object instead.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
class A {
  static a() {}
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
class A {
  static a() {}

  constructor() {}
}
```
