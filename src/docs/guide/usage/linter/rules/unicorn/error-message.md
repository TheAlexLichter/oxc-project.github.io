# unicorn/error-message <Badge type="info" text="Style" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

This rule enforces a `message` value to be passed in when creating an instance of a built-in `Error` object, which leads to more readable and debuggable code.

### Why is this bad?

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
throw Error();
throw new TypeError();
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
throw new Error("Unexpected token");
throw new TypeError("Number expected");
```
