### What it does

disallow `then` property

### Why is this bad?

If an object is defined as "thenable", once it's accidentally
used in an await expression, it may cause problems:

### Example

```javascript
async function example() {
  const foo = {
    unicorn: 1,
    then() {},
  };

  const { unicorn } = await foo;

  console.log("after"); //<- This will never execute
}
```
